                <p>As a front-end developer, I am passionate about creating beautiful and intuitive user-friendly websites that provide a great user experience.  Though I may not have prior work experience in the field, my dedication to learning and improving my skills has allowed me to create various projects to showcase my abilities.</p>
                <p>My journey into coding began by accident when I took a programing course, and  I quickly realized it aligned with my love for problem-solving and creating things.  Since then I have immersed myself in the world of web development, learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and supporting technologies to create visually appealing and easy to use websites.  I am continuously expanding my knowledge and am eager to learn and grow.</p>
                <p>In my free time I enjoy pursuing my hobbies of archery and canoeing, archery requires focus and canoeing requires persistence, both of which are required by coding.  I am excited to continue exploring new challenges and opportunities in the world of front-end development and to collaborate with other passionate individuals to create smooth and memorable experiences for users.</p>
